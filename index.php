<p>Welcomem to the Players Portal.  It is through this portal that registered Battle Royale players can <a href="${ROOT}/tournaments">join tournaments</a>, <a href="${ROOT}/tournaments">create new tournaments</a>, and <a href="${ROOT}/seats">choose their seats</a>.</p>
<p>New this year for Battle Royale VI, we are trying a new tournaments mechanism: we have Major Tournaments, and Crowdsourced Tournaments.</p>

<h2>Major Tournaments</h2>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">These are tournaments that the Battle Royale Organizing Committee will run. These tournaments will have strict schedules, specific rulesets, and large prizes. Your participation in these tournaments is limited by your ticket type: you can join up to the number of tournaments you have purchased. However, if you want to upgrade your ticket type, you can do so at either of the IEEE offices at uOttawa or Carleton, and also at the event itself.</p>

<h2>Crowdsourced Tournaments</h2>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">These are tournaments that will be organized by players themselves. For example, many players will be running various Minecraft servers. These tournaments can be of very casual nature, or serious, but will be organized by the players themselves: it is up to them to arrange the schedules (avoiding conflicts with the Major Tournaments if they like), choose the rules, and make the bracketing. These tournaments are free to join, no matter which ticket type you have purchased. Initially, these tournaments will not have prizes provided by Battle Royale, but prizes will be assigned to the popular tournaments.</p>

<p>To manage registrations to the tournaments, use the interface on the <a href="${ROOT}/tournaments">Tournaments page</a> to make your selections.</p>
